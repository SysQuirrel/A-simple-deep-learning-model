# Neural Network on the stress level dataset
Recently there are increasing instances where students are taking their lives due to academic stress. So, I thought of why not building a model which can predict such stress level in students? You can find the dataset on Kaggle or [here](https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/mdsultanulislamovi/student-stress-monitoring-datasets/).
